What is TaskLoading?

TaskLoading is a full-stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that empowers citizens to report local civic issues — such as potholes, garbage dumps, and broken infrastructure — directly from their location.

Users can submit issue reports with:

 Image uploads via Cloudinary

 Live geolocation or manually entered address

 Category-wise classification (Road, Garbage, Water, etc.)

This project demonstrates the use of:

 Authentication & protected routes with JWT and Redux Toolkit

 File uploads using Multer + Cloudinary integration

 RTK Query for frontend-backend communication

 A modern UI built with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI

Ideal for showcasing full-stack development skills and solving real-world problems with clean architecture and RESTful API design.
